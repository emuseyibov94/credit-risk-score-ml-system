Business Problem

A financial institution wants to assess the probability that a loan applicant will default.
The goal is to build a Credit Risk Scoring AI system that:

Predicts whether a customer is high-risk or low-risk.

Is explainable and compliant with EU regulations.

Can be deployed as an API to support automated decisioning.
